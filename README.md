# python *cute* 'deploy' - newer use a batch script again

## Motivation

As power users and developers we love the full power of the terminal. Core features of the command line to manage the files and directories are really convenient and can easily be bundled together with the power of pipes.

Even cooler is it to create a list of commands to automate the boring work.
For many years this meant to write batch-scritps (on MS Windows) or bash-scripts (on the other systems).
Even with the rise of new and more modern shells (pwsh, zsh, ksh) scripting is still not so conveniant as I would like it to have.

For example: 
- I want to move some files - but not all the files - from location 1 to location 2. Maybe location 2 has the correct structure maybe not.
- I want to archive files after coping them to the new place 
- I want to modify or evaluate file names (e.g. add version and revision info) and post process them.

Independend of what we are trying to do, somehow all the scripts tend to become complex and would really need things like configuration files, debugging features or a full featured logging.
